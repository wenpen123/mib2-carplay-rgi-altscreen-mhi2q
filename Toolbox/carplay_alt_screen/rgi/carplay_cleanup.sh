# This script is identity-less: smartphone_integrator does not tell it WHICH
# dio_manager generation it is cleaning up for.  So it must NOT touch anything shared
# across generations, or it can damage a replacement generation that has already
# started:
#   - it does NOT create the global stop marker — a late write would make a freshly
#     started replacement monitor observe it and kill the NEW dio_manager;
#   - it does NOT stop renderers by the shared PID files — those may already name the
#     replacement generation's renderers.
# Renderers are process-persistent services and survive ordinary dio replacement;
# they clear their session state and accept the next hook/Java connection. Here
# we only run Audi's stock mdnsd/PPS cleanup. Renderers exit on their own failure,
# reboot, or an explicit maintenance action outside this identity-less callback.
