# Writes /mnt/app/root/hooks/cluster_shift.cfg (full_dx / small_dx in pixels); the RGI
# Java re-reads it within a second and moves the plane, no reconnect needed.
#   sporttest          Classic only: in the small view (VIEW button) move the plane by
#                      -476 px as Sport does, to check the Sport placement on a Classic car
# Sport clusters get their -476 small-view offset from the stock layout without this file.
